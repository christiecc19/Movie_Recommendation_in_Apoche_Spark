# Movie_Recommendation_in_Apoche_Spark

This project designed  a hybrid recommendation  system  for the  movie recommendation datase

Trained an Alternating Least Square (ALS) model with 5 latent factors and 5 regularization terms to predict the missing movie ratings. 

Optimized the ALS algorithm with Spark RDD-based MLib API by minimizing root-mean-square error 

Summarized the key insights by evaluating the model performance and investigating the underlying patterns of dataset.
